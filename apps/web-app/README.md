## Project Overview

This is the web app that serves as the frontend user interface for ZK Proof of Humanity](https://github.com/elmol/zk-proof-of-humanity).

The main objective of this dapp is to provide a user-friendly experience for both registered and non-registered ZK Proof of Humanity users to easily and securely verify their humanity, while maintaining anonymity.

It's a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) based project and features a customizable ``<Button\>`` react component that guides users through the entire process, from registration to human verification.  This process can be visualized in the accompanying flow graph.

> Note: The human verification is conducted using a random `externalNullifier` and the signal `I'm human`
